Part 1: Statrting the Design
The first part of the assignment was to design the application that is to be dedicated to the food menu. During this phase, I concentrated on the graphic implementation of the app and how the UI should appear. It was aimed at achieving better looking design that will attract people and make it easy to use the interface.

In this process I focused on the structure of the site because it is important that it is easy to navigate and attractively designed. To recreate a real menu I divided the project into sections and grouped these sections according to the prevailing category, which are Appetizers, Main Courses and Desserts, and created general names of the items, for instance, Caesar Salad for Appetizers, Margherita Pizza for Main Course, and Cheesecake for the Desserts Section. In an attempt of being on the same level with the theme of the app, which is food, the colors and fonts were chosen to depict warmth and professionalism.

This stage was to do with the look of the app with virtually no functionality in it. This phase made me appreciate the need to creating an application as well as esthetically appealing and did allow me to us my creative skills. To be able to bring my ideas to a pen and paper then capture it on paper was so fulfilling.


Part 2: Turning Design Into Code
The second part of the practical included the attempt of turning the static structure into a functional app and for that an actual code was used. Transitions between design and development phases were always an exciting challenge to me. I had to code several appellative components of the application including the food menu which included name, price and image of each menu, shopping cart feature.

The particular focus during this phase set the shopping cart in the centre of attention. Customers can now choose products on the menu that they want for order and place the same in the cart. I added a “Remove” button to let the users unselect what they don’t want anymore. The usage of this feature demanded that I develop the logic for the cart state which allows for the addition and deletion of items.

Some of the problems I faced while coding the app are discussed below; This include; State management and real-time updating of the app UI. These were challenges that made me learn on how to debug, test and make tests make my program in order to enable proper running in order to give a good user interface. This phase was also a discovery phase as I forced myself to start thinking more like a developer than designing like a designer.
Part 3: Extension of the App with New Facilities
The last component of the assignment demanded from me to enhance the application and provide it with additional features. This phase was about improving the user experience by introducing a categorization feature to the application. It was to make users able to segregate different menus according to their genres; Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, or Drinks, for instance.

To bring into practice this feature meant that the menu data needed to be changed to include the categories and a filtering mechanism. I followed this up by including a new screen the result of the filters a user has applied so that they can scroll through their favorite menu options. This addition made the app more useful because it brought order and customization of the content relevant to users.

In addition, I included a couple of minor aesthetic enhancements that I thought enhanced the app’s current look and feel, namely, animations and transitions. In this phase, the advancements showcased how minor incremental changes have a massive impact on improving an app.
